# currency-exchange
This is a new version of one of the project I had to do in TBC bootcamp. I improved and refactored it. The app allows users to exchange currency from GEL to USD and vice versa. The changeDetectionStrategy is onPush, archicecture is feature based and I use container-presentation model, Subjects, Observables, Dependency Injection, HttpClient, interpolation, event binding and the styles are added using scss.
